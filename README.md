The use of gifs in our society has become more popular over the years, conversations have become easier to understand and text messages are given more context with a simple moving image. For this reason, we believe that True That! is able to bring another fun and original game experience for the users. With the use of the Giphy API and Socket.io, users are able to search, select and share gifs during the course of the game they're playing with other connected users . The main game mode that True That! brings to the party consists of the use of themed prompts in which the other participants have to react to with a chosen Gif within the time limit. Overall, True That! is capable of delivering users a great local or online game experience that is fun, funny, and completely easy to handle.
